# wallpapers
This repository is for the wallpapers I like, nothing special other than that.

If you want to download these, I'm including the URLs to the images (if I have
them) instead of all the images. I'm doing it this way so that it doesn't take
up unnecessary space on the Github servers.

For images I can't find the links for, I will put up the image files.

If anyone sees any copyrighted images (as files), please let me know and I will
remove them and put the link instead.

My current wallpaper is [this one](https://wallhaven.cc/w/md85ok)
(1.05 in the
[urls file](https://github.com/hussein-esmail7/wallpapers/blob/main/urls))
